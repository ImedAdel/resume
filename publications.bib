abstract={Since 2012, Wikidata has been developed as a freely accessible and community generated knowledge database that represents not only the name of each item (tree, famous person...) in all available languages but also to define links (like "component of", "born in", "instance of"...) between items. Nowadays, the output of Wikidata has become one of the greatest semantic web data in the world and has been proved to be useful to solve many currently existing problems in Computational Linguistics, in Medicine, and in many other fields. In this research work, we propose to convert Wikidata into a multilingual multi-dialectal dictionary for Arabic dialects and we explain how Wikidata as a multi-lingual multi-dialectal dictionary for Arabic dialects can be later used for the natural language processing of the varieties of Arabic by computational linguists and computer scientists.},
